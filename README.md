Right now my focus is in front end web based programming and application development. I am working with languages such as php, html, and JS
-- I would like to pick up a little more proficiency with SQL and JQuery so that I can implement more back end features.
Various languages that I have used in the past are C++, Java, C as well as some work with projects in Python and Haskell.

A little bit about myself. I love to watch sports in my freetime, no matter what sport it is, if it is on TV I will watch it. I aslo love to 
play sports. I grew up playing baseball, basketball and golf, but golf is my true love. I also really enjoy doing projects and becoming a more 
efficient programmer in my freetime.
