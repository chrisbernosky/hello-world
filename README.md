Hello my name is Chris Bernosky, I am an undergraduate at the University of Kansas studying Computer Engineering and minoring in Business.

Right now my focus is in front end web based programming and application development. I am working with languages such as php, html, and JS
-- I would like to pick up a little more proficiency with SQL and JQuery so that I can implement more back end features.
Various languages that I have used in the past are C++, Java, C as well as some work with projects in Python and Haskell.

A little bit about myself. I love to watch sports in my freetime, no matter what sport it is, if it is on TV I will watch it. I aslo love to 
play sports. I grew up playing baseball, basketball and golf, but golf is my true love. I also really enjoy doing projects and becoming a more 
efficient programmer in my freetime.

This summer I will be working as an intern at VeriShip, Inc. in Kansas City. This internship will focus on front end web development as 
well as application development, which is why I am more than excited to get going with this.

As a CoE at the University of Kansas I love to play around on computers. One of my favorite classes at KU so far has been EECS 368: Programming Language Paradigms because of the amount of sheer programming it has taught me. For our first project, we created a tetris solver using JS. The second project that was just completed was a sudoku solve for a lotus flower, where there were three sets of arrays of 7 that had to be checked for solvability using the traditional sudoku rules. This project was completed in Haskell. The final project is a group based project that will be a website that is a blog website. This website will have its own user interface and use languages such as mySQL, PHP, HTML, JS, and JQuery.
